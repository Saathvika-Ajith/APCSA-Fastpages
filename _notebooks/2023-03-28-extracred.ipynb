    "A point made during this presentation that really stuck with me is how flexible the majors system is in college. I used to think that it's really very rigid, and that you needed to know what you wanted to be when you grew up when you were like 5 and then pick only the most relevant and stick with it all 4 years of college, and whatever years beyond that you spend on your degree. But the presenters helped me understand more about when people say it's okay to change your major in college, and why it is. Even stranger, it seems you can get a graduate degree in something totally different than your undergrad just because it interested your more. As long as you are willing to put in the extra work needed, you change change your mind and pursue your passion anytime in these formative years, which is very relaxing to hear. I've been set on doing Aerospace Engineering for a while, but things change and interests shift, so it's always good to have this reassurance. Another thing I thought about during this is that just because you don't get into a name brand college doesn't mean that you can't have a good education, as CSSM isn't a college I've heard about much before, but it seems like a great place that really helps put people on good career paths."
