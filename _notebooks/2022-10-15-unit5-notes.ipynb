    "## **Naming Conventions**\n",
    "- Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. \n",
    "- Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.\n",
    "- Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic- that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Components - \n",
    "- Class: blueprint used to create objects\n",
    "  - Instance variables/attributes (data)\n",
    "  - Constructors\n",
    "  - Methods\n",
    "    - Accessors/Getters\n",
    "    - Mutators/Setters\n",
    "    - Main method (tester)\n",
    "- Objects: instances of a class\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords -\n",
    "- Control access and visibility of classes, data and methods\n",
    "  - public: no restricted access (can be accessed outside the declaring class)\n",
    "    - Classes \n",
    "    - Constructors\n",
    "  - private: restrict access to declaring class\n",
    "    - Instance variables\n",
    "  - Methods can be designated as public or private\n",
    "  - **this Keyword**\n",
    "    - Refers to current object in a method or constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept of OOP\n",
    "1. Variables and methods are wrapped in a unit (class)\n",
    "2. Implementation details of the class are hidden from the user\n",
    "- Benefits\n",
    "  - Restrict access to read-only  or write-only through accessor/mutator methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "- Initialize instance variables when an object is created\n",
    "- \"Has-a\" relationship\n",
    "  - Each object has attributes which are the instance variables declared inside the class\n",
    "- Constructors set the initial state of an object by assigning initial values to the instance variables\n",
    "  - Object's state: Attributes of an object and their values at a given time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hack 2 - \n",
    "- notice use of **static variables** and **class variables**\n",
    "- also notice use of **static methods** and **class methods**"
