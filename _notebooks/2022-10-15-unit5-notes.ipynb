    "- `Method names` should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.\n",
    "- `Variable names` should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic- that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Components - \n",
    "- Class: blueprint used to create objects\n",
    "  - Instance variables/attributes (data)\n",

    "  - public: no restricted access (can be accessed outside the declaring class)\n",

    "    - Instance variables\n",

    "    - Refers to current object in a method or constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept of OOP\n",
    "1. Variables and methods are wrapped in a unit (class)\n",
    "2. Implementation details of the class are hidden from the user\n",
    "- Benefits\n",
    "  - Restrict access to read-only  or write-only through accessor/mutator methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "- Initialize instance variables when an object is created\n",
    "- \"Has-a\" relationship\n",
